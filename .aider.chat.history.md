Technical Specification (TS) – Crypto Alchemy & Chaos App
1. Project Overview

In the swirling ether of blockchain stars, the Crypto Alchemy & Chaos App manifests wealth and risk as living entities. Users summon coins, whisper to wallets, and navigate the cryptic tides of market chaos. Profit, loss, and paranoia dance together in a mystical symphony.

Purpose: Transform mundane portfolio management into an arcane ritual of numbers, charts, and random chaos.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Summoning the Coins

Add coins via ritualistic gestures (manual entry) or invoke through exchange API keys (Binance, Kraken, Coinbase).

Track quantity, mystical purchase price, astral date.

Observe invisible threads of correlation linking your coins to market destinies.

2.2 Chaos & Risk Oracles

Portfolio volatility shown as fluctuating flame graphs.

Sharpe ratio appears as an aura; max drawdown as storm clouds.

Simulate apocalyptic scenarios: sudden 50% dips, meteoric rises.

Alerts whisper warnings when overexposed to a single currency’s dark magic.

2.3 Automated Rituals (Trading Bots)

Bot familiars obey commands: Buy, Sell, or Hover in shadow.

Strategies: “Moonlight Entry”, “Shadow Exit”, “The Panic Dance”.

Test in phantom realm (paper trading) before risking corporeal coins.

2.4 Portals & Visualization

Dashboard portal: shows portfolio essence, bot familiars, risk aura.

Candlestick crystals with mystical overlays (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).

Pie charts of allocation appear as spinning talismans.

2.5 Alerts & Incantations

Push notifications as whispers of fate: “BTC trembles!”, “ETH ascends!”

Vibrations mimic heartbeat of crypto cosmos.

2.6 Security & Enchantments

API keys and wallet secrets sealed in encryption runes.

Multi-factor authentication: finger, face, or secret chant.

Optional “Cold Vault” integration for items too precious for mortal eyes.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Real-time price updates faster than the blink of a quantum cat.

Offline Mode: Charts persist in dreamscape even when disconnected.

UI: Surreal, glyph-inspired design with light/dark mystic modes.

Storage: SQLite, Realm, Hive — coffers for coins and secrets.

4. Technical Stack

Mobile: Flutter or React Native, enchanted with notifications.

Backend: Node.js/Django with WebSocket portals.

Market Data: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, exchange familiars.

Security: End-to-end encryption runes, 2FA, biometric wards.

5. Future Enhancements

AI Oracle predicts market prophecies.

Social Coven: share spells (strategies) with other summoners.

DeFi portals and staking circles.

NFT familiars appearing in your portfolio aura.

Gamification: achievements for surviving market eclipses or taming volatile coins.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

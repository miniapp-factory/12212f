+Code the following app
+```
+Technical Specification (TS) – Crypto Alchemy & Chaos App
+1. Project Overview
+
+In the swirling ether of blockchain stars, the Crypto Alchemy & Chaos App manifests wealth and risk as living entities. Users summon coins, whisper to wallets, and navigate the cryptic tides of market chaos. Profit, loss, and paranoia dance together in a mystical symphony.
+
+Purpose: Transform mundane portfolio management into an arcane ritual of numbers, charts, and random chaos.
+
+2. Functional Requirements
+2.1 Summoning the Coins
+
+Add coins via ritualistic gestures (manual entry) or invoke through exchange API keys (Binance, Kraken, Coinbase).
+
+Track quantity, mystical purchase price, astral date.
+
+Observe invisible threads of correlation linking your coins to market destinies.
+
+2.2 Chaos & Risk Oracles
+
+Portfolio volatility shown as fluctuating flame graphs.
+
+Sharpe ratio appears as an aura; max drawdown as storm clouds.
+
+Simulate apocalyptic scenarios: sudden 50% dips, meteoric rises.
+
+Alerts whisper warnings when overexposed to a single currency’s dark magic.
+
+2.3 Automated Rituals (Trading Bots)
+
+Bot familiars obey commands: Buy, Sell, or Hover in shadow.
+
+Strategies: “Moonlight Entry”, “Shadow Exit”, “The Panic Dance”.
+
+Test in phantom realm (paper trading) before risking corporeal coins.
+
+2.4 Portals & Visualization
+
+Dashboard portal: shows portfolio essence, bot familiars, risk aura.
+
+Candlestick crystals with mystical overlays (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).
+
+Pie charts of allocation appear as spinning talismans.
+
+2.5 Alerts & Incantations
+
+Push notifications as whispers of fate: “BTC trembles!”, “ETH ascends!”
+
+Vibrations mimic heartbeat of crypto cosmos.
+
+2.6 Security & Enchantments
+
+API keys and wallet secrets sealed in encryption runes.
+
+Multi-factor authentication: finger, face, or secret chant.
+
+Optional “Cold Vault” integration for items too precious for mortal eyes.
+
+3. Non-Functional Requirements
+
+Performance: Real-time price updates faster than the blink of a quantum cat.
+
+Offline Mode: Charts persist in dreamscape even when disconnected.
+
+UI: Surreal, glyph-inspired design with light/dark mystic modes.
+
+Storage: SQLite, Realm, Hive — coffers for coins and secrets.
+
+4. Technical Stack
+
+Mobile: Flutter or React Native, enchanted with notifications.
+
+Backend: Node.js/Django with WebSocket portals.
+
+Market Data: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, exchange familiars.
+
+Security: End-to-end encryption runes, 2FA, biometric wards.
+
+5. Future Enhancements
+
+AI Oracle predicts market prophecies.
+
+Social Coven: share spells (strategies) with other summoners.
+
+DeFi portals and staking circles.
+
+NFT familiars appearing in your portfolio aura.
+
+Gamification: achievements for surviving market eclipses or taming volatile coins.
